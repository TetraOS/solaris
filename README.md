## Reporting Bugs 🪲

Bugs should be reported to the [issue tracking system](github.com/TetraOS/solaris/issues).

Please note that the issue tracker is meant to be used for actionable issues only.

For support questions, feedback on changes or general discussions, you can use:

- [Discussions tab](https://github.com/TetraOS/solaris/discussions) for this repoistory
- Send the main TetraOS Team an email at: [tetraos.team@gmail.com](mailto:tetraos.team@gmail.com)

## Feature Requests 🙌

Solaris is a core compoment of the Cosmos Desktop Environment. As such, any changes in behavior or appearance only happen in accordance with the TetraOS team.

For major changes, it is best to start a discussion, and only involve the issue tracker once agreement has been reached. For enhancements that are limited in scope and well-defined, it is acceptable to directly open a feature request. When in doubt, it is better to ask before opening an issue.

## Contributing 🤝

If you want to help improve the software, you can share your ideas by making merge requests at https://github.com/TetraOS/solaris. If your suggestion needs more than just a code review, it's a good idea to start a discussion by opening an issue first or following the process for feature requests. Otherwise, you don't have to create a separate issue.

Here are some tips to make sure your contribution gets accepted:

- Try to keep your changes small. If you can, break them into several merge requests.
- Make multiple commits. This makes it easier to review and find bugs later on.
- Write clear commit messages following the guidelines.

There's also a [helpful guide](doc/newcomers_guide.md) for new contributors with some additional tips and tricks.

Please refer to the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
